# Why Are Cars In Singapore So Expensive?
**01/24/2018**

So for class today, we had to do an infographic on any topic. Having been in Lehigh for the past two weeks I realised that quite a number of students own their own cars. Having a car for anyone brings about so much convenience but back in Singapore, it's wishful thinking for the average student to own a car. Some middle class families are not even able to afford one for themseleves. Let's explore the reasons that results in making car ownership in Singapore as one of the most expensive ones, if not the most expensive one in the world!

Thus, this is how Camry L (2.5L) that costs US$24390 in the US will cost US$114,504 in Singapore. 

| **Item**  |  **Cost ($USD)** |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| OMV  | 23,959  |
| ARF  | 27,427  |
| Excise Duty & GST  | 30,762  |
| COE  |  32,356 |
| **Basic Cost**  | **114,504**  |
| Dealer's Margin (33%) | 28,884  |
| **Final Sale Price**  |  **143,388**  |

# JS Timeline Practice

For this week's assignment we were asked to tell a story using a timeline. The Singapore story is a miracle. Despite all odds, the nation managed to transform from third world to first. Here's the story.

# Line Chart Assignment
**02/12/18**

Our next assignment involved building charts to compare a trend that changes over time. This turned out to be a really fast and simple way to turn the data into a line chart. Upon learning about the task I was very excited to be able to share this story with you all. It is a story about football and of course the two bet players on the planet â€“ Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo

The two of them have been well known for scoring lots of goals throughout their career. But who has had a better scoring record and who ultimately scored more goals? Well the chart I am about to share with you will tell you more!
