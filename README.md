# Why Are Cars In Singapore So Expensive?
**01/24/2018**

So for class today, we had to do an infographic on any topic. Having been in Lehigh for the past two weeks I realised that quite a number of students own their own cars. Having a car for anyone brings about so much convenience but back in Singapore, it's wishful thinking for the average student to own a car. Some middle class families are not even able to afford one for themseleves. Let's explore the reasons that results in making car ownership in Singapore as one of the most expensive ones, if not the most expensive one in the world!

Thus, this is how Camry L (2.5L) that costs US$24390 in the US will cost US$114,504 in Singapore. 

| **Item**  |  **Cost ($USD)** |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| OMV  | 23,959  |
| ARF  | 27,427  |
| Excise Duty & GST  | 30,762  |
| COE  |  32,356 |
| **Basic Cost**  | **114,504**  |
| Dealer's Margin (33%) | 28,884  |
| **Final Sale Price**  |  **143,388**  |

# JS Timeline Practice

**01/31/2018**


For this week's assignment we were asked to tell a story using a timeline. The Singapore story is a miracle. Despite all odds, the nation managed to transform from third world to first. Here's the story.

# Line Chart Assignment
**02/12/18**

Our next assignment involved building charts to compare a trend that changes over time. This turned out to be a really fast and simple way to turn the data into a line chart. Upon learning about the task I was very excited to be able to share this story with you all. It is a story about football and of course the two bet players on the planet â€“ Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo

The two of them have been well known for scoring lots of goals throughout their career. But who has had a better scoring record and who ultimately scored more goals? Well the chart I am about to share with you will tell you more!

After mapping my data on the spreadsheet and then plotting it on the chart we noticed that Messi has out scored Ronaldo on several occasions. Namely in seasons: '08, '09, '11, '12 and '16 where he actually scored close to 75 goals in the '11 season. That being said, it does not take away the fact of how great a footballer the two of them are. We are blessed indeed to live in the era of these two great soccer players. 

# Google Fusion Table Assignment

The next assignment we were handed had us required to make a map using Google Fusion Tables to show various places. Thinking that it will be fun to introduces places in Singapore, I made a map aimed at showing people who may have just 24 hours in Singapore the places they can go, the nature they can find and nice places to eat.

# Tableau Assignment

Obesity has been a longstanding problem in America. The rising rate of obese American adults across states cannot be attributed to unhealthy food consumption alone. Instead, it is the largely inactive lifestyle Americans lead. 

I decided to look into the changing obesity trends across states between 2015 and 2016. My first two sheets contained a heat map of the most obese states from rank 1 to 51. The most obese states are in the darkest shade and gets lighter to the least obese state in America. 

For my third sheet, I chose to compare the change in rankings across states using the scatter plot visualization. One thing that frustrated me was not being able to put the two sets of data on the same plot and it had to be separated into two. Nonetheless, I hope the visualizations have been informative. Hover over each data set to find out more.
