# Why Are Cars In Singapore So Expensive?

So for class today, we had to do an infographic on any topic. Having been in Lehigh for the past two weeks I realised that quite a number of students own their own cars. Having a car for anyone brings about so much convenience but back in Singapore, it's wishful thinking for the average student to own a car. Some middle class families are not even able to afford one for themseleves. Let's explore the reasons that results in making car ownership in Singapore as one of the most expensive ones, if not the most expensive one in the world!

Thus, this is how Camry L (2.5L) that costs US$24390 in the US will cost US$114,504 in Singapore. 

| **Item**  |  **Cost ($USD)** |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| OMV  | 23,959  |
| ARF  | 27,427  |
| Excise Duty & GST  | 30,762  |
| COE  |  32,356 |
| **Basic Cost**  | **114,504**  |
| Dealer's Margin (33%) | 28,884  |
| **Final Sale Price**  |  **143,388**  |
