# About Me

I am Darren Ching, a second year student at the Nanyang Technological University, Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information.

Currently, I am on an exchange semester in the United States at Lehigh University, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.

To get to know me better, you can visit me on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/manucraze). 

One of my favourite images is this of me atop Mount Rinjani in Lombok, Indonesia

So for class today, we had to do an infographic on any topic. Having been in Lehigh for the past two weeks I realised that quite a number of students own their own cars. Having a car for anyone brings about so much convenience but back in Singapore, it's wishful thinking for the average student to own a car. Some middle class families are not even able to afford one for themseleves. Let's explore the reasons that results in making car ownership in Singapore as one of the most expensive ones, if not the most expensive one in the world!
